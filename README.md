This is my Stage 0 task submission for the HNG 12 Frontend Wizards track.
The project is a responsive, accessible Profile Card built using semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

It displays my name, a short bio, avatar, hobbies, dislikes, social links, and a live time display that updates every second.
This task demonstrates my understanding of semantic structure, accessibility, and modern frontend development patterns using plain HTML/CSS/JS no frameworks.


* Features:

- Semantic HTML elements (<article>, <section>, <figure>, <nav>, etc.)

- Modern, mobile-first design with responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries

- Real-time clock that updates every second and shows both readable time and milliseconds

- Social links that open in a new tab safely (target="_blank" + rel="noopener noreferrer")

- Fully keyboard-accessible and screen-reader-friendly

- Clean, minimal, and professional user interface


* Technologies Used

- HTML5 — For structure and semantics
