            <p>
                I'm a passionate frontend developer with a love for creating beautiful, accessible, and user-friendly web experiences. 
                I started my journey in web development because I was fascinated by how code can transform ideas into interactive digital products. 
                Every day, I strive to improve my skills and stay updated with the latest web technologies.

            <h2>Goals in the Program</h2>
            <p>
                My primary goal in this program is to deepen my understanding of frontend development best practices and build a strong foundation 
                in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want to master responsive design, accessibility standards, and modern web development workflows. 
                Additionally, I aim to contribute to open-source projects and build a portfolio that showcases my growth as a developer.

        <!-- Areas of low confidence section -->
        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence" class="about-section">
            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
                While I'm comfortable with HTML and CSS fundamentals, I still feel less confident with advanced JavaScript concepts like closures, 
                async/await patterns, and complex state management. I'm also working on improving my understanding of performance optimization 
                and debugging techniques. However, I'm committed to addressing these gaps through consistent practice and learning.
